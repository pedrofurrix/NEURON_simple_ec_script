#xc[0] and xg[0] - net radial capacitance and conductance in the extracellular layer that is immediately adjacent to the cell membrane
#xc[1] and xg[1] - net radial capacitance and conductance in the outer extracellular layer 
#Default values are xg[i] = 1e9, xc[i] = 0.0 xraxial[i] = 1e9
#They can be manipulated to simulate myelinization

====xtra=====
v - Membrane Potential in mV
is - Global current for potential calculation in mA 
ex - Extracellular potential in mV - connected to extracellular.e

====calcrx====
Rho - Medium Resistance in Ohm*cm
b - distance  between electrodes in um # the function is not working atm
c - distance between electrodes and axon in um
[xe],[ye],[ze] - lists containing electrodes' positions in um
#0.01 converts rho's cm to um and ohm to megohm
rx_xtra assigned by setrx1 and homogenous in MOhms #homogenous is also wrong, don't use

>>set_uniform_field_between_plates 
v_plate - potential difference between the plates in V 
distance - distance between the plates in m
#Converted to mV/um to give the field_strength
field_orientation - orientation of the E-field
ref_point - 0 potential reference point
displacement and field_component - absolute distance and distance in the direction of the field from the reference point in um
rx_xtra - here, takes units of kV (equivalent to MOhm in the ex calculation equation) - considering the conversion factor.
# Disregarding the conversion factors - unit is mV/Ohm
# A current of 1mA will make it so that ex has the nominal value of rx_xtra
#Here, rx_xtra can take negative values, to adjust for the difference in potential being negative in the direction of the E-field
